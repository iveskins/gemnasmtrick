  "readme": "Shallow diff\n=============\n\nMake a shallow diff between two objects/arrays to get what has been updated/deleted/added or remains unchanged.\nIt will not traverse the whole structure, only the top level items/property.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n```bash\nnpm install shallow-diff\n```\n\nHow to use\n==========\n\nRequire shallow-diff:\n\n```bash\nvar diff = require(\"shallow-diff\");\n```\n\nGet the diff between two objects:\n\n```js\nvar base = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4, f:6};\nvar compared = {a:1, b:20, d: 4, e: 5};\n\ndiff(base, compared);\n// returns\n// {\n//    unchanged: [\"a\", \"d\"],\n//    updated: [\"b\"],\n//    deleted: [\"f\"],\n//    added: [\"e\"]\n// }\n```\n\nGet the diff between two arrays:\n\n```js\nvar base = [10, 20, 30]\nvar compared = [15, 20]\n\ndiff(base, compared);\n// returns:\n// {\n//    unchanged: [1],\n//    updated: [0],\n//    deleted: [2],\n//    added: []\n// }\n```\n\nCHANGELOG\n=========\n\n## 0.0.5 - 9 JUN 2015\n\n* Also update to simple loop 0.0.4 to remove its dependency on assert. Thanks to [@markdalgleish](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish).\n\n## 0.0.4 - 7 MAY 2015\n\n* Remove dependency on assert and replace with own function. Saves 17kb in the end after browserfication. Thanks to [@tomekwi](https://github.com/tomekwi).\n\n### 0.0.3 - 8 APR 2015\n\n* Fix a bug where undefined values would appear in the diff as added and deleted. [See #1](https://github.com/cosmosio/shallow-diff/pull/1). Thanks to [@sverrejoh](https://github.com/sverrejoh)\n\nLICENSE\n=======\n\nMIT\n",
